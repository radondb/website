# What is RadonDB MySQL Kubernetes？
## Overview
RadonDB MySQL is an open source, highly available and cloud native cluster solution based on MySQL. It supports one master multi slave high availability architecture, and has a full set of management functions such as security, automatic backup, monitoring alarm and automatic capacity expansion. At present, it has been used on a large scale in the production environment. Users include banks, insurance, traditional large enterprises and so on. Service high availability is implemented by Xenon, an open source MySQL Cluster High Availability component.

With the vigorous development of cloud native technology at home and abroad and the maturity of database containerization technology, users in major k8s communities are constantly calling for MySQL on k8s high availability. The community decided to completely transplant **RadonDB Mysql to k8s platform (RadonDB MySQL Kubernetes)**, and officially open source it in 2021. The project aims to provide an enterprise level MySQL on k8s high availability solution for k8s and MySQL developers.

Radondb MySQL Kubernetes supports installation, deployment and management on **Kubernetes, KubeSphere, Rancher** and other platforms, and automatically performs tasks related to running radondb MySQL clusters.
